# ## Topics in Pandas
# **Stats 507, Fall 2021** 
# 
# + [Topic dongming dongming@umich]
# For this question, please pick a topic - such as a function, class, method, recipe or idiom related to the pandas python library and create a short tutorial or overview of that topic. The only rules are below.
#     1. Pick a topic not covered in the class slides.
#     2. Do not knowingly pick the same topic as someone else.
#     3. Use bullet points and titles (level 2 headers) to create the equivalent of 3-5 “slides” of key points. They shouldn’t actually be slides, but please structure your key points in a manner similar to the class slides (viewed as a notebook).
#     4. Include executable example code in code cells to illustrate your topic.
# You do not need to clear your topic with me. If you want feedback on your topic choice, please discuss with me or a GSI in office hours.
